        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Britain found itself facing both Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the war, so Deutsch, German and Linzer Biscuits all suddenly felt like unpatriotic names. Because of this (bear in mind this was still in the days of the British Empire), the more patriotic name of Empire Biscuit was born.</p>
        <p><u><i>Empire Biscuits/Empire Cookies</i></u> are simply classic Scottish bakery fare. Two plain biscuits are sandwiched together, topped with icing and a candied cherry.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Jam filled shortbread cookies have been a longtime favorite on Scottish and English tea tables. Now popular in Canada! Store in a covered tin.</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanila extract</li>
